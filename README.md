# üé• Motion Detection Tool
A command-line motion detection utility built with OpenCV, designed for analyzing video footage and automatically identifying moments of motion within a specified region. The program supports frame saving, interactive calibration, logging, and optional chapter tagging in output videos using FFmpeg.

## üì¶ Features
Detect motion within a user-defined rectangular area.
Save frames where motion is detected.
Skip frames to improve performance on long videos.
Configure sensitivity, detection area, and minimum motion size.
Interactive GUI calibration of the detection area.
Export motion timestamps to a text file.
Optional integration with FFmpeg to add or remove chapters in video based on motion events.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
C++17
OpenCV (tested with OpenCV 4.x)
FFmpeg (for chapter export/removal)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Usage
./motion_detector [options] Basic Options Option Description -h Show help and exit -i Input video file (default: input.mp4) -o Output log file for detected motion timestamps (default: motion_times.txt) -d

Directory to save detected motion frames (default: detected_frames) -s Analyze every n-th frame (default: 20) -t Motion threshold (pixel difference; lower = more sensitive; default: 25) -a Minimum contour area in pixels to count as motion (default: 500) -C Cooldown period in seconds between detections (default: 20.0) -z Enter interactive calibration mode (define detection area with mouse) Detection Area Options Option Description -x X coordinate of detection area's top-left corner (default: 100) -y Y coordinate of detection area's top-left corner (default: 100) -w Width of detection area (default: 200) -H Height of detection area (default: 200) Chapter Tagging (FFmpeg Integration) Option Description -M Add chapters to the video using timestamps in the output file -R Remove existing chapters from the video

## üß† How It Works
Frame Comparison: The tool processes every n-th frame (configurable with -s) and compares it to the previous processed frame.

Motion Area: Only a specific rectangular region (default or calibrated) is analyzed for motion.

Thresholding: If pixel differences between two frames exceed a threshold (-t), it is considered motion.

Contours: Binary difference images are analyzed to find contours (connected motion regions). Only contours larger than a given area (-a) are counted as valid motion.

Cooldown: After detecting motion, a cooldown period (-C) is enforced to avoid repeated detection of the same event.

Saving Frames: Detected motion frames are saved as .jpg files in the specified directory with timestamps in the filename.

Logging: Timestamps of motion events are written to a text file for further processing.

## üß™ Example Commands
bash
```
Show help
./motion_detector -h

Basic usage with defaults
./motion_detector

# Use a custom video and detection directory
./motion_detector -i video.mp4 -d results/

# Analyze every 10th frame for faster processing
./motion_detector -s 10

# Set a custom detection area
./motion_detector -x 1000 -y 500 -w 600 -H 400

# Calibrate area interactively (use mouse)
./motion_detector -z

# Increase sensitivity (lower threshold)
./motion_detector -t 15

# Ignore small movements (increase contour area)
./motion_detector -a 1000

# Set shorter cooldown (in seconds)
./motion_detector -C 10

# Add chapters to video based on motion
./motion_detector -i video.mp4 -M -o motion_times.txt

# Remove chapters from video
./motion_detector -i video.mp4 -R
```

## üñºÔ∏è Calibration Mode (-z)
Enter an interactive window where you can drag and resize the detection rectangle using your mouse. Press Enter or s to save the configuration, which will be stored in calibration.dat.

Use the output printed in terminal to reuse the calibrated values:

Use the following CLI options for detection: -x 1000 -y 500 -w 600 -H 400

## üìÅ Output
Log File (motion_times.txt): Contains readable timestamps for when motion was detected.

Detection Frames: Saved as JPEG files in the specified directory, named like:

detected_frames/frame_0001_00h02m45s.jpg

## üìå Key Parameters Explained
Parameter Meaning frameSkip (-s) Number of frames to skip between checks. Lower = more accurate but slower. motionThreshold (-t) Pixel intensity difference needed to register motion. Lower = more sensitive. minContourArea (-a) Minimum size (in pixels) of detected object to be considered motion. Useful to filter out noise. cooldownSeconds (-C) Time delay after a motion event before detecting again. Prevents multiple triggers for the same motion. detectionArea (-x, -y, -w, -H) Defines the rectangular region where motion is checked. Motion outside is ignored. üé¨ FFmpeg Integration If compiled with FFmpeg support, the tool can embed chapter metadata into the video based on motion log, or remove existing chapter tracks:

## Add chapters:
./motion_detector -i input.mp4 -M -o motion_times.txt

## Remove chapters:
./motion_detector -i input.mp4 -R

## üìÇ File Structure (after build)
bash
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motion_detector          # Motion detection binary
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calibration.dat          # Saved detection area after calibration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ motion_times.txt         # Log file with motion timestamps

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input.mp4                # Input video file
